      <p>
        I currently work as analyst in the Martime industry. When I find some time
        to myself during the work week I am usually studying finance and investing. In
        my freetime I enjoy skating, yoga, and building fun programming projects. I believe
        learning is a life-long endeavor and am always reading about something.
